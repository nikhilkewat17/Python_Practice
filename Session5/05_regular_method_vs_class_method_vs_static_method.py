# Regular Method (display_character):
#       Uses self to access and display instance-specific data such as the character's
#       name and level.
# Class Method (from_string):
#       Uses cls to access and manipulate data related to the class as a whole, like the total
#       number of game characters created. Useful for actions that affect the entire class rather
#       than individual instances.
# Static Method (can_level_up):
#       Does not need access to either instance-specific data or class-specific data. It simply
#       provides utility functionality to determine if a character can level up based on
#       experience points, making it completely independent of the character's state.


# Study Drills :
# 1. Try to run class method using instances and Using class figure out the difference
# 2. Create GamePlayer from a String with and without class method
