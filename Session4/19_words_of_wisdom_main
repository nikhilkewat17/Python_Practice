The line `if __name__ == "__main__":`
    is a common idiom in Python scripts. It allows a script to determine whether
    it's being run as the main program or being imported as a module into another script.

Here's how it works:

1. `__name__`:
        In Python, `__name__` is a special built-in variable that holds the name of the
        current module. When a Python script is executed, Python sets `__name__` to
        `"__main__"` if the script is being run as the main program.

2. `if __name__ == "__main__":`:
        This line checks if the value of `__name__` is equal to `"__main__"`. If it is,
        it means the script is being run as the main program and not imported as a module.

3. Execution:
        If the condition `__name__ == "__main__"` evaluates to `True`, the code block
        under the `if` statement is executed. This typically contains the code that you
        want to run when the script is executed directly.

Here's why this idiom is useful:

- It allows you to write code that can be both imported as a module and run as a
  standalone script.
- Code inside the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is executed only when the script
  is run directly, not when it's imported as a module. This prevents code in the script
  from being executed inadvertently when it's imported elsewhere.
