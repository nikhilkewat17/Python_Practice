Exception handling is :
      a programming construct that allows you to handle errors or
      exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of a program. In Python,
      exceptions are raised when an error occurs, and they can be caught and handled using
      'try-except' blocks.

Here are some reasons why we use exception handling in Python and the benefits it
provides:

1. Error Detection and Recovery:
        Exception handling helps in detecting errors that occur during program execution
        and provides a mechanism to recover from them gracefully. Instead of crashing the
        program, you can handle errors in a controlled manner.

2. Improved Code Robustness:
        By handling exceptions, you make your code more robust and resilient to errors.
        Even if unexpected conditions arise, your program can continue to execute without
        being terminated abruptly.

3. Clarity of Code:
        Exception handling improves the readability of code by separating error-handling
        logic from the main program logic. This makes the code easier to understand and
        maintain.

4. Debugging and Troubleshooting:
        When an exception occurs, Python provides traceback information that helps in
        identifying the cause of the error. This information is valuable for debugging
        and troubleshooting issues in your code.

5. Graceful Program Termination:
        Exception handling allows you to perform cleanup operations or take appropriate
        actions before terminating the program. For example, you can close open files,
        release resources, or log error messages before exiting the program.

6. Handling Expected Errors:
        Exception handling allows you to anticipate and handle specific errors that you
        expect might occur during the execution of your program. This enables you to
        provide meaningful error messages or take alternative actions to recover from the
        error.

7. Fault Isolation:
        Exception handling helps in isolating faults by containing the impact of errors
        within specific sections of code. By catching exceptions at appropriate places,
        you can prevent errors from propagating to other parts of the program.

8. Better User Experience:
        When exceptions are handled properly, it improves the overall user experience
        of the application. Instead of presenting users with cryptic error messages or
        crashing unexpectedly, you can provide informative messages and guide users on
        how to resolve issues.
